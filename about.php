	<a href="index.php" style="text-decoration:none;font-size:15px; color:#0D366F;">Vaarta</a>. This is also a social site just like other sites are out there. I wanted some change in facebook, I had suggested
                  but then I thought why not build one. My site has no competition with other social sites, I like them all.This one is also 
               similar to others. I would like to add as much as audience I can. If you like this site please invite your friends also.  </div>
                  
				   <div id="content_body">
				   Right Now I have designed this site, and that's why There will be so many things that you would not like. If so, then 
				   you can email me on - <a href="#" style="text-decoration:none;color:#0D366F;font-style:verdana;font-size:15px;">

				    I would love to hear from you all. One more thing I would like to add. This site has some Indian touch. Right now I am working on it.
					It's not fully designed. But I assure you all that soon you all will see so many Indian touch out there. This will make you feel home.
					And even if you are not Indian, I hope you will enjoy using it also. </div><br> 
					
					<div id="content_body">
					There are so many things that I have added here, and I would love to tell you all that by myself. But Best way to 
					Know about something or someone, just give it time. 					
					</div>
					<div id="content_body">
					I am not any college graduate. Actually I never been there, so maybe I fail to give it professional touch. But I expect 
					from you all to guide my train in right direction.
